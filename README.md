engine = sa.create_engine('postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db')
df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM revenue_data', engine)
```

### API Integration
```python
# Example REST API integration
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.yourcompany.com/metrics')
data = response.json()
```

### File-based Data
```python
# CSV/Excel integration
df = pd.read_csv('business_data.csv')
df = pd.read_excel('quarterly_reports.xlsx')
```
